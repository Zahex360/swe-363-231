        <p>
          My name is Zahid Alabadllah. I am 21 years old. I study
          <em> computer science at KFUPM </em>. I enjoy reading, playing
          football, watching movies, and many more activities. I also like
          meeting new people.

        <h2>CS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Science (CS) is like the
          <em id="the_most_important">magic behind computers</em>. It's the
          <em> art of telling computers what to do </em>, how to do it, and
          solving problems with them. Imagine you're giving instructions to a
          robot â€“ that's what programmers do. They write code, which is a set of
          instructions that a computer can understand, to make things happen,
          like playing games, sending emails, or running apps. CS is all about
          creating and improving software, making computers smarter, and finding
          cool ways to use technology in our everyday lives. It's like being a
          wizard of the digital world!

        <h2>me & CS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Science is like a
          <em>personal journey of discovery for me</em>. It's the art of giving
          instructions to computers, making them do incredible things. As a
          programmer, I write code to make the magic happen, whether it's
          creating apps, games, or solving real-world problems. CS empowers me
          to explore, create, and bring my ideas to life using technology. It's
          not just a subject; it's a tool that enables me to express my
          creativity and make a meaningful impact in the digital world.

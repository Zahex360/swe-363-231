        <h2>ME</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Zahid Alabadllah. I am 21 years old. I study computer
          science at KFUPM. I enjoy reading, playing football, watching movies,
          and many more activities. I also like meeting new people.

        <h2>CS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Science (CS) is like the magic behind computers. It's the art
          of telling computers what to do, how to do it, and solving problems
          with them. Imagine you're giving instructions to a robot â€“ that's what
          programmers do. They write code, which is a set of instructions that a
          computer can understand, to make things happen, like playing games,
          sending emails, or running apps. CS is all about creating and
          improving software, making computers smarter, and finding cool ways to
          use technology in our everyday lives. It's like being a wizard of the
          digital world!

        <h2>ME & CS</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Science is like a personal journey of discovery for me. It's
          the art of giving instructions to computers, making them do incredible
          things. As a programmer, I write code to make the magic happen,
          whether it's creating apps, games, or solving real-world problems. CS
          empowers me to explore, create, and bring my ideas to life using
          technology. It's not just a subject; it's a tool that enables me to
          express my creativity and make a meaningful impact in the digital
          world.
